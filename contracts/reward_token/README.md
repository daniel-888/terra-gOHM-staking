# gOHM Reward Token

This is a reward cw20 token which users could get by gOHM staking.
Users can burn this token to get Luna and gOHM rewards.

This is a basic implementation of a cw20 contract. It implements
the [CW20 spec](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus/tree/master/packages/cw20) and is designed to
be deloyed as is, or imported into other contracts to easily build
cw20-compatible tokens with custom logic.

Implements:

- [x] CW20 Base
- [x] Mintable extension
- [x] Burnable extension

## Running this contract

You will need Rust 1.44.1+ with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.

You can run unit tests on this via:

`cargo test`

Once you are happy with the content, you can compile it to wasm via:

```
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw20_base.wasm .
ls -l cw20_base.wasm
sha256sum cw20_base.wasm
```

Or for a production-ready (compressed) build, run the following from the
repository root:

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="cosmwasm_plus_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.10.2
```

The optimized contracts are generated in the `artifacts/` directory.
